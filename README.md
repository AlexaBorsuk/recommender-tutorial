# Intro to Recommendation Systems in Python

### Skill level: intermediate

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Lab
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Alternatively, you can also use Googleâ€™s new [colab platform](https://colab.research.google.com) which allows you to run a Jupyter notebook environment in the cloud. You won't need to locally install any of the above; however, you will need a gmail account. 

### Description

In this tutorial, we will explore different types of recommendation systems and their implementations. We will build our own recommendation system using data from the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) database and tools from scikit-learn.
