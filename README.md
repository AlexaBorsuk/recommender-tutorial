# Intro to Recommendation Systems in Python

### Skill level: intermediate

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Lab
- scikit-learn
- numpy 

Alternatively, you can also use Googleâ€™s new [colab](https://colab.research.google.com) feature which allows you to run a Jupiter notebook environment in the cloud. 

### Description

In this workshop, we will explore the different types of recommendation systems and their implementations. We will also build our own recommendation system using data from the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) database.

### What is a recommendation system?

The goal of a recommendation system is to predict a user's preference toward an item.

**Examples:**

- recommending products based on past purchases or product searches (Amazon)
- suggesting TV shows or movies based on prediction of a user's interests (Netflix)
- creating well-curated playlists based on song history (Spotify)

### Types of Recommendation Systems

1. Collaborative Filtering
