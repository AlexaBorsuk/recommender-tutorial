### Skill level: intermediate

### Requirements

Alternatively, you can also use Googleâ€™s new [colab platform](https://colab.research.google.com) which allows you to run a Jupyter notebook environment in the cloud. You won't need to locally install any of the above; however, you will need a gmail account. 

### Description

In this tutorial, we will explore the different types of recommendation systems and their implementations. We will also build our own recommendation system using data from the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) database.

See PyLadies presentation slides [here](pyladies-slides.pdf).

More information on recommendation systems can be found in this [overview](recommender-basics.md).
