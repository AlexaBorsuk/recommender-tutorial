# Recommendation Systems 101

This series of tutorials explores different types of recommendation systems and their implementations. Key topics include:
- collaborative vs. content-based filtering
- implicit vs. explicit feedback
- handling the cold start problem
- recommendation model evaluation

We will build various recommendation systems using data from the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) database. You will need Jupyter Lab to run the notebooks for each part of this series. Alternatively, you can also use Googleâ€™s new [colab platform](https://colab.research.google.com) which allows you to run a Jupyter notebook environment in the cloud. You won't need to install any local dependencies; however, you will need a gmail account. 

The series is divided into 5 parts:
1. [Building an item-item recommendation system from scratch](#part-1-building-an-item-item-recommendation-system-from-scratch)
2. [Predicting user ratings](#part-2-predicting-user-ratings)
3. [Handling the cold start problem](#part-3-handling-the-cold-start-problem)
4. [Building an implicit-feedback recommendation system](#part-4-building-an-implicit-feedback-recommendation-system)
5. [Evaluating the performance of a recommendation model](#part-5-evaluating-the-performance-of-a-recommendation-model) 

More information on each part can be found in the descriptions below.

### Part 1: Building an item-item recommendation system from scratch

In this tutorial, we will build an item-item recommendation system by computing similarity using nearest neighbor techniques.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Lab
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

### Part 2: Predicting user ratings

In this tutorial, we will attempt to predict how a user would rate a new movie based on their previous ratings. 

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Lab
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Part 3: Handling the cold start problem

In this tutorial, we will employ clustering techniques to tackle the cold start problem of collaborative filtering. 

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Lab
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
