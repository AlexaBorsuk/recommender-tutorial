# Recommendation Systems 101

This series of tutorials explores different types of recommendation systems and their implementations. Key topics include:
- collaborative vs. content-based filtering
- implicit vs. explicit feedback
- recommendation model evaluation

We will build our own recommendation systems using data from the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) database.

### Part 1: Building a recommendation system from scratch

In this tutorial, we will build an item-item recommendation system by computing similarity using nearest neighbour techniques.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Lab
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Alternatively, you can also use Googleâ€™s new [colab platform](https://colab.research.google.com) which allows you to run a Jupyter notebook environment in the cloud. You won't need to locally install any of the above; however, you will need a gmail account. 

### Part 2: Predicting user ratings

In this tutorial, we will attempt to predict how a user would rate a new movie based on their previous ratings. 

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Lab
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Part 3: Handling the cold start problem

In this tutorial, we will employ clustering techniques to tackle the cold start problem of collaborative filtering. 

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Lab
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
