# Recommendation Systems 101

This series of tutorials explores different types of recommendation systems and their implementations. Topics include:

- collaborative vs. content-based filtering
- implicit vs. explicit feedback
- handling the cold start problem
- recommendation model evaluation

We will build various recommendation systems using data from the [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) database. You will need Jupyter Lab to run the notebooks for each part of this series. Alternatively, you can also use Googleâ€™s new [colab platform](https://colab.research.google.com) which allows you to run a Jupyter notebook environment in the cloud. You won't need to install any local dependencies; however, you will need a gmail account. 

The series is divided into 5 parts:

1. [Building an item-item recommender with collaborative filtering](#part-1-building-an-item-item-recommender-with-collaborative-filtering)
2. [Handling the Cold Start Problem with Content-based Filtering](#part-2-handling-the-cold-start-problem-with-content-based-filtering)
3. [Enhancing the Quality of Recommendations with Matrix Factorizationm](#part-3-enhancing-the-quality-of-recommendations-with-matrix-factorization)
4. [Building an implicit-feedback recommendation system](#part-4-building-an-implicit-feedback-recommendation-system)
5. [Evaluating the performance of a recommendation model](#part-5-evaluating-the-performance-of-a-recommendation-model) 

More information on each part can be found in the descriptions below.

### Part 1: Building an Item-Item Recommender with Collaborative Filtering

| |Description |
|:-----------|:----------|
|Objective|Want to know how Spotify, Amazon, and Netflix generate "similar item" recommendations for users? In this tutorial, we will build an item-item recommendation system by computing similarity using nearest neighbor techniques.|
|Key concepts|collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, k-Nearest neighbors, cosine similarity|
|Requirements|Python 3.6+, Jupyter Lab, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn|
|Tutorial link|[Jupyter Notebook](part-1-item-item-recommender.ipynb)|
